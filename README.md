# WordFrequenciesByGender_Abstracts

THIS PROJECT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

This research project aims to examine the variations in word frequency among academic articles that were authored by both men and women, compared to those that were solely written by men. The study intends to investigate potential gender disparities in the use of language and its impact on academic writing.

This repository (currently) contains 3 python files: namesByGender.py, dataPreprocessing.py, and TFIDF.py. I will address the specific functions of these files below. 

namesByGender.py

The primary funciton of namesByGender.py is to process and sanitize a dataset, which aims to classify commonly used names based on their most probable gender. The output of this file is a cleaned dataset that we will merged with our abstracts database in order to predict the the likely genders of the authors. 

This program uses a dataset generated by a machine learning project at the University of California, Irvine, which can be accessed at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gender+by+Name. Initially, the dataset is structured such that each name is represented twice as both male and female, accompanied by their respective probabilities. To use this dataset effectively, this code removes the observation with the lower probability using a simple loop. The final output of this file is a cleaned dataset called cleanedNames.csv

dataPreprocessing.py

The primary function of dataPreprocessing.py is to preprocess a dataset containing authors and abstracts, and prepare it for analysis. 

In order to accomplish this, I first merge together two datasets countaining authors and abstracts respectively. I do this based on an id variable that was included in the dataset for this purpose. A then clean the resulting dataset and generate a firstname feature. 

Next, I preprocess the words within the abstract. I begin by removing special characters and stopwords. Then, I convert all characters to lowercase and stem each word. Finally, I merge this cleaned dataset with the cleanedNames data and save the resulting output as final.csv. 

TFIDF.py

The primary purpose of this file is to generate word frequencies. 

In order to accomplish this, I employ the methodology of Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to evaluate the significance of each word in a given document relative to its occurrence in the entire corpus. This approach allows me to rank words according to their relative importance in each author's paper, facilitating the identification of potential gender-based disparities in writing styles.
