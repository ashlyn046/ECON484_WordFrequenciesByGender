# WordFrequenciesByGender_Abstracts

This repository contains ___ python files 

The main funciton of namesByGender.py is to read in and clean a dataset for classifying common names by their most-likely gender. The output of this file is a cleaned dataset ready to be merged with our abstracts database to predict the likely genders of the authors. 

More specifically, this file reads in a dataset generated by a machine learning project centered at UCI. The dataset can be found at the following URL: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gender+by+Name. Initally, this dataset is formatted such that each included name appears as observations two times: once as female, and once as male with the associated probabilities. In order to use this dataset in the desired manner, I only want each name to appear in one observation. Thus, for each name, I drop the observation of that name that has the lower probability. I accomplish this with a simple loop. The final output of this file is cleanedNames.csv
